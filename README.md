Set a new environment with python 3.10 with this command:
conda create --name <env_name> python=3.8

After successfully creating the environment, you need to activate it by issuing this command:

conda activate <env_name>

use the following command to install the required dependencies:
pip install -r requirements.txt

This command can take a while to run depending on the speed of your internet connection. Once this step completes you should be ready to spin up jupyter lab and begin running my .ipynb file.
